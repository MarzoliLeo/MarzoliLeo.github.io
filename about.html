                  <h3>What inspired you to pursue a career as a game designer?</h3>
                  My journey as a game designer began at a young age when I was introduced to World of Warcraft, a renowned fantasy MMORPG, by my older brother. From my first experience playing the game, I was immediately captivated by its immersive world and intricate gameplay. This sparked a passion within me to create my own games and offer players similar captivating experiences. Over the years, I have honed my skills and knowledge in the field through education and hands-on experience, and I am now dedicated to designing engaging and entertaining games that captivate players in the same way that World of Warcraft captured me.                  
                  <h3>What do you believe sets your designs apart from others in the industry?</h3>
                  I believe that what sets my designs apart from others in the industry is my focus on creating unique and immersive experiences for players. I take a player-centric approach to game design, carefully considering what players want and need from a game, and incorporating that into my designs. I also pay close attention to the little details that can make a big impact, such as the game's soundtrack, graphics, and overall atmosphere. Additionally, I stay up-to-date on the latest trends and technology in the industry to ensure that my designs are cutting-edge and stand out from the competition. By combining my technical skills, creative vision, and player-focused approach, I am confident that my designs offer something truly unique and enjoyable for players.
                  <h3>How do you ensure that your designs are both challenging and fun for players?</h3>
                  Ensuring that my designs are both challenging and fun for players is a top priority for me. To achieve this, I rely on the principles outlined in the book "The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses" by Jesse Schell. In this book, Schell explains the importance of designing games that are both engaging and challenging for players. I follow this guidance by carefully balancing the difficulty level of my games, providing players with just the right amount of challenge to keep them motivated and engaged. Additionally, I strive to create fun, entertaining experiences that players will want to keep coming back to. By combining challenging gameplay with enjoyable experiences, I am confident that my designs will provide players with a rewarding and satisfying gaming experience.
                  <h3>Can you tell us about a particularly memorable project you have worked on and what you learned from it?</h3>
                  <p>
                    One particularly memorable project that I worked on was a multiplayer deathmatch game I created as a college exam project. I was part of a team that I had handpicked, and we worked together to bring the game to life. The project was a great learning experience for me as it allowed me to put into practice many of the theories and techniques I had learned in my game design classes. It was also an opportunity for me to collaborate with a team and see how different perspectives and skills can come together to create something truly special.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What I learned from this project was the importance of communication and collaboration in game design. Working with a team allowed me to better understand the value of each person's contribution and how to effectively communicate my own ideas. Additionally, I learned about the challenges of creating a multiplayer game and how to overcome them. Overall, this project was a great stepping stone for me in my game design career, and I am proud of what we were able to achieve together as a team.
